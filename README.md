Planned Functions:

1. Scan designated folder(s) for media to build a sqlite db.
2. For each song, designate which playlists it should belong to.
3. For each playlist, sort files by path, metadata, or manual override.
4. Designate playlists for sync to remote destination.
5. When "Syncing", only copy files that are found in at least one selected playlist.
6. Transcode to MP3 on the fly during sync, keeping metadata and location in playlist. 
7. Preview Sync total file size.
